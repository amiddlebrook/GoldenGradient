Title: Golden Gradient — a tiny optimizer that beats Adam by refusing bad steps

Body:
I built a gradient optimizer that does *less* than Adam.

Instead of adapting step sizes, it preserves the raw gradient and only applies updates when the direction is consistent with recent history (using a golden-ratio threshold).

On oscillatory loss surfaces where Adam zig-zags forever, this accumulates monotonic gains.
