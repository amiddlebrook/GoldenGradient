Figure 1 (self-contained):
Cumulative gain versus iteration on an oscillatory loss surface with rotating principal curvature.
Gold: Golden Gradient; Red: gradient descent.
Golden Gradient accumulates sustained monotonic gains by rejecting directionally inconsistent updates,
while adaptive optimizers fail due to variance amplification and curvature misalignment.
